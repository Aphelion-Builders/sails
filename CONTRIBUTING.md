# How to contribute
The community is what makes Sails great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues
1. If you have a question about setting up/using Sails, please check out the [Sails docs](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation) or try searching  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sails.js).
2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/search?type=Issues) and [Google](https://www.google.nl/search?q=sails+js). 
3. Feature requests are very welcome, but we would prefer to keep them separate from actual issues with the framework. If you want to submit a feature request, please post it on our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/cGzNVE0b/sails-js-feature-requests). You can do so by emailing the issue to sailsfeaturerequests+wlhnmobeqngolth6lh6z@boards.trello.com. You can put the name of the request in the subject line, and the description in the body. It can sometimes take a few minutes for it to appear on the board, so please be patient if you don't see it right away.
4. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
5. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
6. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - The sails version (find this with ````sails -v````).
  - Detailed explanation of how to recreate the issue
7. If you are experiencing more than one problem, create a separate issue for each one. If you think they might be related, please reference the other issues you've created.
